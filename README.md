# JavaScript Drill - Car Data Processing (With Methods)

This branch enhances the `main` branch by implementing reusable functions to improve code modularity. Additionally, all functionalities are tested using the files inside the `test` folder.
```

## Project Structure
```
├── database.js # Contains the car dataset
├── test
│ ├── test1.js # Test file for problem1.js 
│ ├── test2.js # Test file for problem2.js 
│ ├── test3.js # Test file for problem3.js 
│ ├── test4.js # Test file for problem4.js 
│ └── test5.js # Test file for problem5.js 
├── problem1.js # Finds all cars of a specific make 
├── problem2.js # Retrieves all unique car models 
├── problem3.js # Groups cars by year 
├── problem4.js # Finds the top 5 most expensive cars 
└── problem5.js # Finds the most expensive car in each make
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone -b withmethods https://github.com Sivakumar1003 js-drill-cars.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd js-drill-cars
   ```
3. **Run the test files using Node.js:**
   ```
   node test/test1.js
   ```
    Replace `test1.js` with any other test file (test2.js, test3.js, etc.) to test the respective problem.
